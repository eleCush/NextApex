9 June 2023

	spark post / email confirm after the stripe billing process -> webhook, or check e-mail w/ stripe on login

	||
	||
	||

	add footer "careers" "products" "about" "contact" 

7 June 2023

	User Profile page? prolly
	link to "simplified billing"


 Get a pro account to write reviews and skip the queue.  Pro accounts will be available later.




NOTES EXTRACT :: 7 JUNE 2023

;; rating-ids are the ratings you made
;; ratings are the ratings given to you by others


;next to add users, who have types (musician, listener, merch-maker), public profile page, and optional billing



;; reviews above are per-track.  can do per-album one where the track field is blank..  might do that.  


;;published-at
;;consider "published-at" date for releasing thingks and then also having them show up in the feed
;;revisits 
;;consider revisits

;okay how many steps away from complete: probably user profile pages, ability to make ratings & make reviews.  so maybe stick up some sample album & art.

;;consider adding clips

;; consider adding posts, which link to other things.  kinda like reviews but with multiple potential content associations. [embeds]






          ;; 12 may 2023 thinking to make it per-
          ;; track reviews
          ;; overall album impression or 


					;;DONE// add input boxen for 
					;; review track
					;; review contents .. should it be an array of paragraphs?



6 june 2023:

add the album art preview and album name and project name to the top bar and have it fixed position on scroll

4 June 2023: build an album list up from the several tracks that you start with so they all get the same album metadata []

[] for each track in AlbumReviewWithReviewInputPage (xD) draw an input box.

REMEWS looks very enticing.  I am actually looking forward to adding content as soon as I stratify the admin/normie views




2 June2023


Join Butan -> stripe -> 
										 -> logins can check stripe db for existancez

limit the number of latest additons on main page (add butan to go to tab)


30 May 2023

27 May 2023


Help me make remews the best it can be


26 May 2023

	mint a "ReviewQueuePage" and "LatestAdditionsPage" and "JoinPage"

26 May 2023 19:51 
	"Review Queue" 
	"Latest Additions"
	"What it is"
	"Join"
	"About"


25 May 2023
	Let's add>>> UI lockdown for rating buttons unless remewserid set


24 May 2023
	nonforum font w/ dice !!!11181818181818


	for < 3 ratings on a piece (?)
	



23 may 14:24:36

Ratings now upsert over the old rating id.  This means each user will have one rating per: reviewQueue item

To implement the same (overwrite if ID present) for track-ratings, clip-ratings, review-ratings


23 May 12:11 PM

rating blocks on review queue should be functional bits

also, login conditional the create blocks of the page, whilst displaying the other real-timey stuff.
so, in short: sockets for all!  just not logins for all x)



20 May 2023 : 12:32AM

Got the rating scaffolding really close.  Now gonna add click events which tie user to the ratings & rewrite in on click.

Then gotta do the query for the score, which will be:

sum up the doubleplus ratings vector on the item [the rating-id is saved, and if inspected, will show who rated it]
sum up the plus ratings vec
sum up the min ratings vec
then show the aggregate score (check out nonforum cljs or rating code on githoob)


next steps: once I have ratings going, I will add rating mechanisms to tracks, to reviews (on tracks and albums), and maybe before those 2 I will do review queue.  cuz that is big and the whole point, really.

Looking really good.

The roadmap to sellable something:

  1. Finish Basic Interface for 
  		A. Album Art & Display Album Single One
  		B. Track Art & Display Track Single One
  		C. Track w/ Review
  		D. Album w/ Review
  		DD. Review Queue
  	

  		E. Then, user logins?
  		G. Tie user logins to all the things
  		H. Add billing via Stripe & 
  		I. Integrate subscription adjustment page "simplified billing"
  		J. Sell
   2. Continue building site to perfection.

   3. For example, consider mobile experience.

   4. Add static pages via the http helper.clj -- might have to make all new components?  Or, just render the text. :think:

   5. I want people joining it TODAY and paying NOW so how to accomplish THAT:

   			Landing page

   			Pre-sale page w/ Explanation & screenshots?

   			I think once I get the basic review queue up and show people the site it'll be interesting

   			Maybe I can set it up this way:

   			Read-only first, just my posts & stuff

   			Then: if you pay you can join (don't need no cell number i reckon)

   			Finally, if you want to vote on stuff you can join for free with a cell number.



   RN: packaging Ratings like a tab on the side side



   Ratings: 

   	CReate the postage stamp that is 3 ui buttons
